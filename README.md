# Glaucoma Detection Using Deep Learning on Retinal Fundus Images

## Overview

Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide. Early detection through retinal fundus imaging plays a critical role in preventing vision loss.

This project implements and compares multiple deep learning models for automated glaucoma detection using retinal fundus images. We evaluate baseline CNN models and advanced transfer learning architectures to determine the most effective approach.

## Objectives

- Develop a baseline CNN model for glaucoma classification  
- Apply transfer learning using state-of-the-art architectures  
- Propose an improved fine-tuned model  
- Compare model performance using standard evaluation metrics  
- Perform detailed result analysis and visualization
